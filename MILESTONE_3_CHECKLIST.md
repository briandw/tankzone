## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **Performance issues**: Implement LOD and culling early
- **Browser compatibility**: Test on multiple browsers regularly
- **Network latency**: Implement robust interpolation and prediction

### Timeline Risks:
- **Complex 3D rendering**: Start with simple geometries, add detail later
- **Input lag**: Prioritize input prediction implementation
- **Testing complexity**: Set up automated testing early
