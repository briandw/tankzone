# Milestone 2: Network Protocol & Client Communication - Checklist

**Goal**: Implement Protocol Buffers communication between server and client.

## 2.1 Protocol Buffer Definitions

### Tasks:
- [ ] Create .proto files for all message types
- [ ] Set up Rust code generation via prost
- [ ] Set up JavaScript code generation via protobuf.js
- [ ] Define PlayerInput message structure
- [ ] Define GameStateUpdate message structure
- [ ] Define GameEvent message structure
- [ ] Define common types (Vector3, TeamColor, etc.)

### Testing Requirements:
- [ ] Unit tests for message serialization in Rust
- [ ] Unit tests for message serialization in JavaScript
- [ ] Cross-platform test: Rust â†” JavaScript message exchange


### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] All .proto files compile successfully
- [ ] Rust code generation works with prost
- [ ] JavaScript code generation works with protobuf.js
- [ ] Messages can be serialized/deserialized in both languages
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified

## 2.2 Client-Server Communication

### Tasks:
- [ ] Enhance WebSocket message handling for Protocol Buffers
- [ ] Implement input message processing with 30Hz rate limiting
- [ ] Create state broadcast system
- [ ] Add message validation and error handling
- [ ] Implement connection lifecycle management

### Testing Requirements:
- [ ] Integration test: Echo server test
- [ ] Integration test: Input validation and rate limiting
- [ ] End-to-end test using headless_chrome
- [ ] Latency test: Round-trip time measurement
- [ ] Load test: Multiple clients sending inputs

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] WebSocket handles Protocol Buffer messages correctly
- [ ] Input rate limiting prevents spam (30Hz max)
- [ ] State broadcasts work reliably
- [ ] Error handling prevents crashes
- [ ] Connection management is robust

## 2.3 State Synchronization

### Tasks:
- [ ] Implement delta compression for state updates
- [ ] Create client-side state interpolation
- [ ] Add lag compensation system
- [ ] Implement state prediction
- [ ] Add network condition handling

### Testing Requirements:
- [ ] Unit tests for delta compression
- [ ] Integration test: State consistency across multiple clients
- [ ] Network condition simulation (latency, packet loss)
- [ ] Headless browser test: Verify interpolation smoothness
- [ ] Performance test: State sync with 50 clients

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Delta compression reduces bandwidth usage
- [ ] Client interpolation provides smooth movement
- [ ] Lag compensation works for high-latency clients
- [ ] State remains consistent across all clients
- [ ] Performance meets requirements under load

---

## Additional Infrastructure Tasks

### Protocol Buffer Setup:
- [ ] Add prost dependencies to Cargo.toml
- [ ] Set up build.rs for proto compilation
- [ ] Create proto/ directory structure
- [ ] Add protobuf.js to client dependencies

### Development Tools:
